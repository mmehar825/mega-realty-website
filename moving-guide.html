    <h1>Moving Guide to Pennsylvania</h1>
    <p>Everything you need to know about relocating to the Keystone State — neighborhoods, costs, schools, and insider tips.</p>

    <h2>Why People Are Moving to Pennsylvania</h2>
    <p>Pennsylvania offers a rare combination of urban energy and suburban tranquility, world-class healthcare and education, and a cost of living that's considerably lower than neighboring states like New Jersey and New York. Whether you're relocating for work, family, or a fresh start, the state has something for everyone.</p>

    <p>Philadelphia, the state's largest city, has experienced a renaissance in recent years — with booming restaurant scenes, revitalized neighborhoods, and a thriving job market in healthcare, education, tech, and finance. But Pennsylvania's appeal extends well beyond Philly, with vibrant communities in the Lehigh Valley, Poconos, Central PA, and Western PA.</p>

    <h2>Top Regions to Consider</h2>

    <div class="article-grid">
      <div class="article-card">
        <div class="article-card-icon"><svg width="24" height="24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M3 9l9-7 9 7v11a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2z"/><polyline points="9 22 9 12 15 12 15 22"/></svg></div>
        <h3>Philadelphia</h3>
        <p>Diverse neighborhoods, walkable culture, top hospitals, and a median home price well below other major East Coast cities. Ideal for young professionals, families, and investors.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article-card">
        <div class="article-card-icon"><svg width="24" height="24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M17 21v-2a4 4 0 0 0-4-4H5a4 4 0 0 0-4 4v2"/><circle cx="9" cy="7" r="4"/><path d="M23 21v-2a4 4 0 0 0-3-3.87"/><path d="M16 3.13a4 4 0 0 1 0 7.75"/></svg></div>
        <h3>Philadelphia Suburbs</h3>
        <p>Montgomery, Bucks, Delaware, and Chester counties offer top-rated schools, larger homes, and easy access to the city via SEPTA regional rail.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article-card">
        <div class="article-card-icon"><svg width="24" height="24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><polyline points="22 12 18 12 15 21 9 3 6 12 2 12"/></svg></div>
        <h3>Lehigh Valley</h3>
        <p>Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton form a growing metro with affordable housing, a strong job market, and a vibrant arts and dining scene.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="article-card">
        <div class="article-card-icon"><svg width="24" height="24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21 10c0 7-9 13-9 13s-9-6-9-13a9 9 0 0 1 18 0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="10" r="3"/></svg></div>
        <h3>Poconos & Beyond</h3>
        <p>Mountain living with year-round recreation, remote work potential, and home prices that are a fraction of what you'd pay closer to the city.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Cost of Living Snapshot</h2>
    <p>Pennsylvania's cost of living is roughly 3–5% below the national average, depending on the region. Housing is the biggest savings — median home prices in Philadelphia are roughly half of what you'd pay in New York City or Boston, and suburban options offer even more value.</p>

    <p>Other key cost factors: Pennsylvania has a flat state income tax of 3.07%, which is lower than most neighboring states. There's no sales tax on groceries or clothing. Property taxes vary by county but are generally reasonable compared to New Jersey.</p>

    <h2>Schools & Education</h2>
    <p>Pennsylvania is home to some of the nation's best public and private schools, from the top-rated suburban districts of Lower Merion, Radnor, and Central Bucks to Philadelphia's magnet school system. The state also boasts a dense network of colleges and universities — including Penn, Temple, Drexel, Villanova, and Lehigh.</p>

    <h2>Getting Around</h2>
    <p>Philadelphia has the best public transit system in the state, with SEPTA buses, subways, trolleys, and regional rail. The Pennsylvania Turnpike connects the major regions east-to-west, and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor makes trips to New York and DC quick and easy.</p>

    <p>For those moving outside the city, a car is the most practical option — but commute times are generally reasonable compared to other major metro areas.</p>
