  <h1>Just Got Your License? Here's Your 90-Day Game Plan</h1>

<h2>The First 90 Days Define Your Career</h2>
<p>You passed the exam. You got your license. Now what? The first 90 days as a new real estate agent are the most critical — and the most overwhelming. Most new agents fail not because they lack talent, but because they lack a plan. They spend weeks "getting set up" and months "building their brand" without ever talking to a potential client. Don't be that agent.</p>
<p>Here's a week-by-week plan to get you from licensed to closing within 90 days.</p>

<h2>Days 1-14: Foundation</h2>
<p><strong>Join the right brokerage.</strong> This decision alone can make or break your first year. Look for a brokerage that offers real support (not just a desk and a login), a commission structure that doesn't punish you for being new, and a culture of actual collaboration. At Mega Realty, new agents keep 100% commission from day one with no monthly fees for the first year — that matters when you're just starting out and every dollar counts.</p>
<p><strong>Set up your systems.</strong> Get a CRM (even a free one like HubSpot), set up your professional email, order business cards, and create or claim your Google Business Profile. Don't overthink this — you need basic tools, not perfect tools. You can upgrade later.</p>
<p><strong>Tell everyone you know.</strong> This is the single most important thing you'll do in your first two weeks. Send a personal message (not a mass email) to every person in your phone, your social media, your email contacts. Tell them you're now a licensed real estate agent and you'd love to help if they or anyone they know is buying or selling. This is your sphere of influence, and it's where your first deal will most likely come from.</p>

<h2>Days 15-30: Activity</h2>
<p><strong>Start making calls.</strong> Call expired listings. Call FSBOs. Call your sphere follow-ups. The phone is the fastest path to business. Aim for 20-30 contacts per day. Most new agents avoid the phone because it's uncomfortable, and that's exactly why the ones who embrace it succeed faster.</p>
<p><strong>Hold open houses.</strong> Ask experienced agents in your brokerage if you can host open houses for their listings. This is free lead generation — you meet buyers face-to-face, practice your pitch, and collect contact information. Aim for at least one open house per weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Learn your market.</strong> Preview homes in your target neighborhoods. Study recent sales. Know the price per square foot, the school ratings, the commute times. When a buyer asks you about an area, you should be able to speak confidently about it without checking your phone.</p>

<h2>Days 31-60: Momentum</h2>
<p><strong>Follow up relentlessly.</strong> Most deals don't come from the first contact — they come from the fifth, sixth, or seventh touch. Set up a follow-up schedule for every lead you've generated and stick to it. A simple text saying "Hey, just checking in — are you still thinking about buying/selling?" keeps you top of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Get social.</strong> Post on social media consistently — not just listings, but market insights, homebuyer tips, neighborhood spotlights, and behind-the-scenes content. You're building credibility and staying visible. Even if it doesn't generate immediate leads, it compounds over time.</p>
<p><strong>Build referral partnerships.</strong> Connect with mortgage lenders, home inspectors, title companies, and insurance agents. These professionals interact with buyers and sellers daily and can send you referrals. Offer to refer business their way in return.</p>

<h2>Days 61-90: Closing</h2>
<p>If you've been consistent with the activities above, you should have active leads by now — buyers you're showing homes to, sellers considering listing, or referrals from your network. Focus on converting these leads to signed agreements and contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Lean on your broker.</strong> Your first contract negotiation is nerve-wracking. Use your brokerage's support — that's what it's there for. Ask questions, have someone review your paperwork, and don't pretend to know things you don't. Clients respect honesty, and your broker wants you to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Close your first deal.</strong> When it happens — and it will if you've been doing the work — celebrate it. Then immediately ask your client for a review, a testimonial, and referrals. Your first closing is the start of your flywheel.</p>
